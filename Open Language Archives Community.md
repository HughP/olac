OLAC: Accessing the World's Language Resources
This site is the work space for a collaborative research project between the Linguistic Data Consortium (at the University of Pennsylvania) and the Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics (in Dallas, Texas) that aims to greatly improve access to language resources for linguists and the broader communities of interest, by achieving an order-of-magnitude increase in the coverage of the Open Language Archives Community along with significant enhancements to its services it offers. (See full proposal.)
